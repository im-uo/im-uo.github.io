 abstract = {The content-style duality is a fundamental element in art. These two dimensions can be easily differentiated by humans: content refers to the objects and concepts in an artwork, and style to the way it looks. Yet, we have not found a way to fully capture this duality with visual representations. While style transfer captures the visual appearance of a single artwork, it fails to generalize to larger sets. Similarly, supervised classification-based methods are impractical since the perception of style lies on a spectrum and not on categorical labels. We thus present GOYA, which captures the artistic knowledge of a cutting-edge generative model for disentangling content and style in art. Experiments show that GOYA explicitly learns to represent the two artistic dimensions (content and style) of the original artistic image, paving the way for leveraging generative models in art analysis.},
