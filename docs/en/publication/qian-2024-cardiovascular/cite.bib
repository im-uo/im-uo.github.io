 abstract = {Despite extensive exploration of potential biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) derived from retinal images, it remains unclear how retinal images contribute to CVD risk profiling and how the results can inform lifestyle modifications. Therefore, we aimed to determine the performance of cardiovascular risk prediction model from retinal images via explicitly estimating 10 traditional CVD risk factors and compared with the model based on actual risk measurements.},
