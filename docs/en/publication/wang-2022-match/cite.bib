 abstract = {Few-shot learning (FSL) approaches, mostly neural network-based, assume that pre-trained knowledge can be obtained from base (seen) classes and transferred to novel (unseen) classes. However, the black-box nature of neural networks makes it difficult to understand what is actually transferred, which may hamper FSL application in some risk-sensitive areas. In this paper, we reveal a new way to perform FSL for image classification, using a visual representation from the backbone model and patterns generated by a self-attention based explainable module. The representation weighted by patterns only includes a minimum number of distinguishable features and the visualized patterns can serve as an informative hint on the transferred knowledge. On three mainstream datasets, experimental results prove that the proposed method can enable satisfying explainability and achieve high classification results.
