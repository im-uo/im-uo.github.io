 abstract = {Facade parsing stands as a pivotal computer vision task with far-reaching applications in areas like architecture, urban planning, and energy efficiency. Despite the recent success of deep learning-based methods in yielding impressive results on certain open-source datasets, their viability for real-world applications remains uncertain. Real-world scenarios are considerably more intricate, demanding greater computational efficiency. Existing datasets often fall short in representing these settings, and previous methods frequently rely on extra detection models to enhance accuracy, which requires much computation cost. In this paper, we first introduce Comprehensive Facade Parsing (CFP), a dataset meticulously designed to encompass the intricacies of real-world facade parsing tasks. Comprising a total of 602 high-resolution street-view images, this dataset captures a diverse array of challenging scenarios, including sloping angles and densely clustered buildings, with painstakingly curated annotations for each image. Moreover, a new pipeline is proposed known as Revision-based Transformer Facade Parsing (RTFP). This marks the pioneering utilization of Vision Transformers (ViT) in facade parsing, and our experimental results definitively substantiate its merit. We also design Line Acquisition, Filtering, and Revision (LAFR), an efficient yet accurate revision algorithm that can improve the segment result solely from simple line detection using prior knowledge of the facade. In ECP 2011, RueMonge 2014, and our CFP, the experimental results verify the superiority of our method. The dataset and code are available at rÌ†lhttps://github.com/wbw520/RTFP.},
