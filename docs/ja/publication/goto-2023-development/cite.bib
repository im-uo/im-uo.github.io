 abstract = {Deep learning is a rapidly-evolving technology with the possibility to significantly improve the physics reach of collider experiments. In this study we developed a novel vertex finding algorithm for future lepton colliders such as the International Linear Collider. We deploy two networks: one consists of simple fully-connected layers to look for vertex seeds from track pairs, and the other is a customized Recurrent Neural Network with an attention mechanism and an encoderâ€“decoder structure to associate tracks to the vertex seeds. The performance of the vertex finder is compared with the standard ILC vertex reconstruction algorithm.},
